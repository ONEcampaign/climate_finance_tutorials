The aim is to increase knowledge about the broad thematic area PSD and contribute to harmonisation between actors, and thereby contribute to increase efficiency within development cooperation. DCED was established in 1979 and formalised in 2006. Sida has been engaged in the DCED several decades and an official member since 2004. Other member donors include for example ADA, Danida, DFID, FAO, ILO, ITC, MasterCard Foundation, Norad, SDC, USAID, the world Bank. The members meet and collaborarate in currently six active thematic working groups:* Business Environment Working Group (BEWG),* Green Growth Working Group (GGWG),* Market Systems Development Working Group (MSDWG),* Private Sector Engagement Working Group (PSEWG),* Results Measurement Working Group (RMWG) and* Women's Economic Empowerment (WEEWG).Through its representation in all working groups and its focal point for DCED Sida is a very active member of the DCED. The DCED is assessed to be a strategic and useful platform for Sida to be active in, and to generate added value through knowledge exchange, methods development, networking and collaboration.Given Sida's positive experience of the DCED, not least during recent years, which clearly demonstrates Sida's ability to influence, collaborate with and benefit from the DCED, Sida intends to remain an active member of the DCED - in individual working groups as well as at a general level through its focal point for coordination of the collaboration. From 2018/19 Sida returns to three-year decisions about DCED membership, in accordance with its initial agreement with the IFC. This is motivated by the very well established relationship and cooperation with the DCED on several levels, Sida's positive experiences, strong engagement and clear benefit from the membership, plus the highly relevant work of the DCED and BEAM Exchange for Sida, in particular for the members of the Network for Employment and Market Development.

Since the pilot in Gambia was successful, project team scales up the model in Sahel region and contribute to the Great Green Wall of Africa initiative by creating interactive forest monitoring map of pilot areas in neighboring countries, which are extremely rich in biodiversity, but also have inadequate forest management systems. While monitoring in Gambia continues, environmental officials and civil society in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal are trained to use the tool and responsible departments trained to independently create and update the map. Involving civil society enables local actors to better participate in decision-making related to land-use and cross-border cooperation enhances networking.Planned activities are carried out with the Gambian partner organization Freedom From Hunger Campaign. In Gambia, the aim is to continue protecting the buffer zone of Kiang West National Park, Gambia's second largest conservation area, and help Jiffarong community to adapt to climate change. Human pressure on forest is reduced through enhanced fire prevention and developing profitable livelihoods to substitute the sale of firewood. In cooperation with the Forestry Department, fire prevention training is organized in communities and schools located in the buffer zone, and district workshop organized to enhance cooperation of the trained communities. Previously created livelihoods are further developed, farmers are trained to grow their businesses and new revolving fund loan takers are chosen and trained to start new businesses, to improve food security. Food security is also improved by adopting new FMNR (farmer managed natural regeneration) technique from Senegal, and training local officials and Jiffarong farmers to use it. Applying the FMNR technique is expected to enhance crop production and improve quality of forest. Restoration activities in the community forest of Jiffarong are also intensified through enhanced operations of the tree nursery.Dodo ry and the local cooperation partner are implementing a project in Gambia in 2021-2022.

Since the pilot in Gambia was successful, project team scales up the model in Sahel region and contribute to the Great Green Wall of Africa initiative by creating interactive forest monitoring map of pilot areas in neighboring countries, which are extremely rich in biodiversity, but also have inadequate forest management systems. While monitoring in Gambia continues, environmental officials and civil society in Guinea-Bissau and Senegal are trained to use the tool and responsible departments trained to independently create and update the map. Involving civil society enables local actors to better participate in decision-making related to land-use and cross-border cooperation enhances networking.Planned activities are carried out with the Gambian partner organization Freedom From Hunger Campaign. In Gambia, the aim is to continue protecting the buffer zone of Kiang West National Park, Gambia's second largest conservation area, and help Jiffarong community to adapt to climate change. Human pressure on forest is reduced through enhanced fire prevention and developing profitable livelihoods to substitute the sale of firewood. In cooperation with the Forestry Department, fire prevention training is organized in communities and schools located in the buffer zone, and district workshop organized to enhance cooperation of the trained communities. Previously created livelihoods are further developed, farmers are trained to grow their businesses and new revolving fund loan takers are chosen and trained to start new businesses, to improve food security. Food security is also improved by adopting new FMNR (farmer managed natural regeneration) technique from Senegal, and training local officials and Jiffarong farmers to use it. Applying the FMNR technique is expected to enhance crop production and improve quality of forest. Restoration activities in the community forest of Jiffarong are also intensified through enhanced operations of the tree nursery.Dodo ry and the local cooperation partner are implementing a project in Gambia in 2021-2022.
