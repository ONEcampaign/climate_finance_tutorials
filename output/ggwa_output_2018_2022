The impact is expected to be increased productivity in family farms through a positive system change, stronger resilience of vulnerable households to climate change, higher income, improved situation for women and strengthened incentives to young men to refuse violent extremism.  The non-governmental organization SOS Sahel International France manages 198 million SEK Swedish funds for the period 15 December 2018 - 31 December 2023 to carry out the project in cooperation with SOS Sahel International Burkina Faso, the small NGO Terre Verte and the programme the Great Green Wall  (La Grande Muraille Verte) of the Ministry of the Environment in Burkina Faso. Cooperation is also on-going with the Ministry of Agriculture, 30 rural municipalities and a number of local organizations.   The project aims to (i) recover eroded farmland and increase productivity for groups of about 30-60 family farmers who have decided to merge their small farm plots into larger a unit of 100-150 hectares, and to (ii) sustainably improve the soil status and increase productivity in family farms through agroecological methods, a broad application of traditional water & soil conservation techniques combined with an initial ploughing and techniques for managing rainwater, composting etc.   The soil & water conservation technique Zaï is implemented systematically.  Collective production units are created through small water dams for rice production and vegetable and fruit gardens. Value chains are supported, particularly for female farmers and entrepreneurs. Women has a key role in agriculture in Burkina Faso and gender equality is prioritised in the project.   The validity of the agreement between Sida and SOSSIF will expire on 30 September 2024.",110,2,C01,usd_disbursement,1547984.0,Adaptation,OECD_CRS,USD,current
